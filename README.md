# üìÖ **Timeline ‚Äì 6 Weeks Plan**

---

## **Week 1: Setup & Background Research**

**Goal:** Understand problem deeply and prepare simulation environment.

* **Day 1‚Äì2:** Read paper carefully, summarize key algorithms.
* **Day 3:** Study **game theory basics** (Nash equilibrium, utility functions).
* **Day 4:** Learn fog-cloud simulation tools (**iFogSim**, Python-based SimPy).
* **Day 5‚Äì6:** Install required tech stack (Python, NumPy, NetworkX, Matplotlib, SimPy/CloudSim if needed).
* **Day 7:** Write simple script to simulate fog nodes & users (just dummy requests).

**Outcome:** Ready simulation environment + base knowledge.

---

## **Week 2: System Design**

**Goal:** Design how your system will look (inputs, outputs, process).

* **Day 1:** Define **inputs** (number of users, fog nodes, resources, demand).
* **Day 2:** Define **outputs** (allocation matrix, prices, latency).
* **Day 3:** Draw **flowchart** and **system model diagram**.
* **Day 4:** Write pseudo-code for resource allocation algorithm.
* **Day 5:** Decide how **dynamic pricing** will be calculated.
* **Day 6‚Äì7:** Write **problem statement document** (finalize for professor).

**Outcome:** Clear design with flowchart + pseudo-code.

---

## **Week 3: Basic Implementation (Without Game Theory)**

**Goal:** Build a simple working version before adding complexity.

* **Day 1:** Implement user request generation (random CPU, memory, latency needs).
* **Day 2:** Implement fog nodes with limited resources.
* **Day 3:** Assign users randomly to fog nodes (baseline).
* **Day 4:** Add simple **fixed pricing** system.
* **Day 5‚Äì6:** Test and visualize results (graph of cost vs demand).
* **Day 7:** Document baseline results.

**Outcome:** A working system with fixed pricing (baseline).

---

## **Week 4: Game Theory & Dynamic Pricing**

**Goal:** Add game-theoretic logic and pricing strategy.

* **Day 1:** Implement utility functions (user wants low cost + low latency, provider wants high profit).
* **Day 2:** Add **dynamic pricing rule** (price ‚Üë if demand ‚Üë, price ‚Üì if demand ‚Üì).
* **Day 3:** Implement **iteration loop** (users choose fog ‚Üí fog updates price ‚Üí repeat).
* **Day 4:** Implement stopping condition (equilibrium).
* **Day 5‚Äì6:** Run simulations with multiple users/fog nodes.
* **Day 7:** Collect results (allocation matrix, final prices).

**Outcome:** Game-theoretic allocation working.

---

## **Week 5: Testing & Use Case Scenarios**

**Goal:** Apply real-world inspired use cases.

* **Day 1:** Smart healthcare case (critical vs normal patient).
* **Day 2:** Smart traffic case (emergency vehicle vs normal car).
* **Day 3:** IoT smart home case (security alarm vs fridge sensor).
* **Day 4‚Äì5:** Compare fixed pricing vs dynamic pricing results.
* **Day 6:** Evaluate metrics (latency, cost fairness, resource utilization).
* **Day 7:** Write results section.

**Outcome:** Results with different use cases.

---

## **Week 6: Finalization**

**Goal:** Write report, polish project, prepare for viva/demo.

* **Day 1‚Äì2:** Prepare final report (abstract, intro, methodology, results, conclusion).
* **Day 3:** Prepare presentation slides.
* **Day 4:** Add graphs (latency vs demand, cost vs nodes).
* **Day 5:** Rehearse explanation with examples.
* **Day 6:** Create final code + documentation.
* **Day 7:** Buffer day (backup work, final polishing).

**Outcome:** Complete project ready for submission.

---

# ‚è≥ **Total Time: 6 Weeks (\~42 Days)**

* Week 1‚Äì2 ‚Üí Background + Design
* Week 3‚Äì4 ‚Üí Implementation (baseline + game theory)
* Week 5 ‚Üí Testing with use cases
* Week 6 ‚Üí Final writing + polishing

---

# üéØ **Final Output of Project**

* A **working simulation** where:

  * Users send requests to fog nodes.
  * Fog nodes change prices dynamically.
  * Allocation happens until balance.
* Graphs showing:

  * Latency vs demand
  * Cost vs number of users
  * Resource utilization
* A **project report + slides**.
* A **demo** showing how a healthcare/traffic use case works.

Would you like me to now **expand this into a day-by-day Gantt chart / timeline diagram** (visual) so it looks very professional to show your professor?  in this week 1 u have asked us to study basics of game thoery and nash equilibrium give all the info required to read and learn for this project
